# StudentUnionWebsite

Website of the Student Union, Nexus (2025-2026 FKLMSTSS)

## Overview

### Trying out the Prototype

You can view the website by [downloading it](https://github.com/HugoXOX3/StudentUnionNexusWebsite/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and hosting it locally using ```python -m http.server 80``` (requires Python 3 environment).

An alternative online prototype is currently available [here](https://lmstnexus2526.pages.dev).

## Basic Information

The website features a bilingual button allowing users to switch between English and Chinese, providing better accessibility for both Chinese-speaking and English-speaking students.

Additionally, we've included a map listing restaurants near our school, enabling students to easily explore dining options with simple clicks. This approach is much more convenient than traditional methods like checking Instagram or leaflets, which typically require more time.

The website also displays upcoming events that we will be hosting.

More features will be added in future updates.

## Website Hosting

We use [Cloudflare Page Hosting Service](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).

Cloudflare Page Hosting Service is completely FREE, making it affordable for any Student Union to adopt this mode. If any Student Union wish to customize your domain name, you can also purchase one to replace the default domain generated by Cloudflare.
